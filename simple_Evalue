## Example with Evalue

data("lead")
lead %>% str()

lead <- lead %>% 
  mutate(lead = factor(lead))

## Evaluate Evalue with OR

model1 <- glm(lead ~ age + male + smoking + income , data = lead, family = 'binomial')
summary(model1)

theme_gtsummary_journal(journal = c('jama'))

model1 %>% 
  tbl_regression(exp = TRUE)

## Univariate Lead smoking and outcome

evalues.OR(2.51, lo = 1.66, hi = 3.8, rare = 1)


## Multiple Bias
